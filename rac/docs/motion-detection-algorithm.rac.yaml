algorithm:
  id: variance-based-motion-detection
  description: Algorithm for detecting device motion using variance of acceleration magnitude
  steps:
    - id: magnitude-calculation
      description: Calculate the magnitude of acceleration vector
      formula: "magnitude = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)"
      where:
        - x: acceleration on x-axis
        - y: acceleration on y-axis
        - z: acceleration on z-axis

    - id: history-management
      description: Maintain a fixed-size history of magnitude values
      properties:
        - size: "Number of recent magnitude values to store"
        - purpose: "Enable variance calculation over time window"
        - update: "Add new magnitude, remove oldest if size exceeded"

    - id: variance-calculation
      description: Calculate variance of magnitude values in history
      formula: "variance = Σ(x - μ)² / n"
      where:
        - x: each magnitude value in history
        - μ: mean of magnitude values
        - n: number of values in history
      purpose: "Measure of how spread out the magnitude values are"

    - id: motion-determination
      description: Determine if device is moving based on variance
      logic: "if variance > threshold then device is moving"
      properties:
        - threshold: "Minimum variance value to consider device moving"
        - purpose: "Distinguish between intentional movement and noise"

    - id: state-debouncing
      description: Prevent rapid state changes
      properties:
        - delay: "Minimum time between state changes"
        - purpose: "Ensure stable motion detection"

sensitivity:
  id: sensitivity-adjustment
  description: Mechanism for adjusting motion detection sensitivity
  properties:
    - name: sensitivity-range
      range: "0-100"
      purpose: "User-defined sensitivity value"
    - name: threshold-scaling
      formula: "adjustedThreshold = baseThreshold * (1 - sensitivity/100)"
      where:
        - sensitivity: "User-defined sensitivity value (0-100)"
        - baseThreshold: "Default motion detection threshold"
      purpose: "Adjust motion detection threshold based on sensitivity"

validation:
  id: motion-validation-rules
  description: Validation rules for motion detection
  rules:
    - id: history-validation
      rule: "magnitudeHistory.length >= 2"
      purpose: "Ensure sufficient data for variance"
    - id: threshold-validation
      rule: "varianceThreshold > 0"
      purpose: "Ensure valid detection threshold"
    - id: state-change-validation
      rule: "currentTime - lastStateChange >= delay"
      purpose: "Enforce debouncing"
    - id: sensitivity-validation
      rule: "sensitivity >= 0 && sensitivity <= 100"
      purpose: "Ensure sensitivity is within valid range"
