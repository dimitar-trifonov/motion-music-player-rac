Here's a step-by-step plan to implement manual mode:

✅ Step 1: Add Control Mode State
Add controlMode to player state
Add isManualControlEnabled flag
Define mode switching logic

✅ Step 2: Create Manual Play/Pause Events
Create manual-play event
Create manual-pause event
Add validation for manual control state

✅ Step 3: Add Mode Switching Events
Create switch-to-manual event
Create switch-to-motion event
Add validation for mode switching

✅ Step 4: Update Existing Events
Modify start-playback to check control mode
Modify stop-playback to check control mode
Keep all other events unchanged

✅ Step 5: Add Mode-Specific Logic
Create validation rules for manual mode
Create validation rules for mode switching
Keep existing motion validation rules

✅ Step 6: Implement Event Priority
Define how manual and motion events interact
Handle potential conflicts
Ensure smooth mode switching

✅ Step 7: Add Error Handling
Add mode-specific error handling
Handle mode switching errors
Maintain existing error handling

✅ Step 10: IDE-Agnostic Bindings

Core UI Structure Binding:
1. Layout Structure:
   - Container hierarchy (div, section, main, etc.)
   - Flex/Grid layout patterns
   - Spacing system (margin/padding)
   - This would map to Tailwind's container, flex, grid, and spacing utilities without being tied to them

2. Component Hierarchy:
   - Parent-child relationships
   - Component composition patterns
   - State sharing boundaries
   - This would map to React's component structure without being tied to React

3. Responsive Design:
   - Breakpoint definitions (sm, md, lg, xl)
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Layout shifts at breakpoints
   - This would map to Tailwind's responsive utilities without being tied to them

4. Theme Structure:
   - Color palette
   - Typography scale
   - Spacing scale
   - This would map to Tailwind's theme configuration without being tied to it

5. Component Patterns:
   - Card layouts
   - Form structures
   - Navigation patterns
   - This would map to common React component patterns without being tied to React

Component Interaction Binding:
1. Component Communication:
   - Event bubbling paths
   - State lifting patterns
   - Context sharing boundaries
   - This would map to React's component communication patterns without being tied to specific implementations

2. State Management:
   - Local state boundaries
   - Shared state patterns
   - State update triggers
   - This would map to React's state management patterns without being tied to specific libraries

3. Event Handling:
   - User interaction points
   - System event triggers
   - Event propagation rules
   - This would map to React's event handling patterns without being tied to specific syntax

4. Data Flow:
   - Unidirectional flow patterns
   - Prop passing rules
   - State update propagation
   - This would map to React's data flow patterns without being tied to specific implementations

Key Principles for Bindings:
- Keep them abstract and technology-agnostic
- Focus on structure and behavior rather than implementation details
- Allow for different visualization and implementation approaches
- Maintain clear relationships between components without prescribing specific solutions
- Enable tools to generate different types of previews (wireframes, mockups, prototypes)

These bindings will enable:
- Visual representation generation
- Interaction simulation
- Application structure validation
- Core functionality testing
- Different types of documentation generation

✅ Bindings Implementation Complete:
- Created core-ui-structure.binding.rac.yaml
- Created component-interaction.binding.rac.yaml
- Verified against binding.schema.rac.yaml
- Ready for application implementation
